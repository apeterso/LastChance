Colby College Last Chance Dance Application
=============================================================================================================
Each year during the week between finals and graduation known as "Senior Week," there is a
dance held on campus forstudents in the senior class. The dance has a connotation of being the "last chance" for
students to connect with one another. This application facilitates those connections. First, the application sends an email to each member of the
senior class with a short message and a link to a Google Form. Email addresses are drawn from an outside file which is
specified while running the application on the command line. Students fill out the Google Form with their name, email
address, and a list of up to 10 other students' names with which they would like to connect. The responses can then be
downloaded in the form of a .csv file. The application scans the file and creates all possible matches. If two students
list each other's names, then a match is recorded. Each student's matches are then automatically sent to them via email.
